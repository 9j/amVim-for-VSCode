# Vim for VSCode

![icon](images/icon.png)

The [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) mode for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that works as expected.


## Why

Because [this](https://github.com/74th/vscode-vim) and [this](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
are missing basic functions(such as multi-cursor support) I need.
And they need a complete refactoring to meet my needs.


## Key features

- Vim style keybindings & looks
- Multi-cursor support


## Not supported

- `:` started commands: Please use `Command Palette` (`Shift+Cmd+P` on OSX, `Shift+Ctrl+P` on Windows) instead.


## Commands
